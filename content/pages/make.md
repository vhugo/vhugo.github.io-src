# A register of projects I worked on.

I've started too many side projects, never to actually finish and publish them.
Usually I lose interest in the topic, or I changed my mind whether it is good
enough to share. Or I keep coming back, but never finish. I hope, this page help
me realize what I've been working on, and maybe helps adding the extra
motivation to finish and publish it.

`TODO` add past projects.
