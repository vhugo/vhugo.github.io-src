# This is a collection of thoughts and experiences

This is a never-ending, working in progress personal website. The idea is to
have a place where I can quietly share projects, ideas and experiments. Sort of
the best proof I can have I exist. [Cogito, ergo sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum)

This is my latest attempt to make and maintain a personal website. Many attempts
came before that and I don't believe this will be the last. This time, I was
highly inspired by [Devine Lu Linvega](https://www.xxvvii.com) and even more so
by the people in the [Webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/) index. Hopefully I
will keep this updated this time around.

I am not a native English speaker, but I am constantly trying to improve my
language skills. I hope I can make it clear enough, but in the case I don't -
please, do not hesitate to contact me and ask questions or suggest relevant
corrections.
